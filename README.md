# Agri-Nexus AI: An AI-Powered Agricultural Extension Chatbot for Lesotho

**A GENIE.AI-Aligned Pilot for the IEEE-ITU "GenAI for Good Challenge"**

Agri-Nexus AI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide real-time, context-aware agricultural advice to farmers in Lesotho. This project is being developed as part of the **IEEE-ITU "GenAI for Good Challenge"** and is aligned with the **GENIE.AI framework**, ITU's open-source AI infrastructure for public services.

## The Challenge: Connecting the World and Beyond

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is celebrating its 160th anniversary with a vision of "Connecting the World and Beyond." This initiative aims to move beyond basic connectivity and toward intelligent, equitable digital ecosystems, particularly in the Global South. The **GenAI for Good Challenge** is a key part of this vision, and Agri-Nexus AI is a direct response to this call to action.

## The Solution: Agri-Nexus AI
